Social Media Engagement Database on Mental Health Posts
Overview

This project explores how audiences engage with mental health–related content across social media platforms.
It focuses on building a relational database to structure engagement data and support analytical queries that reveal patterns related to emotional tone, platform context, and user interaction.

The project is designed as a portfolio-ready data and analytics project, demonstrating skills in database design, data analysis, and applied research.

Project Goals

Build a structured database to organize cross-platform social media engagement data

Analyze how emotional tone and mental health themes relate to user engagement

Compare engagement patterns across different social media platforms

Demonstrate practical data modeling and querying skills for real-world analysis

Data & Schema Design

The database is structured using a relational model to support flexible analysis.

Core components include:

Social media posts with mental health–related content

Engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments, shares)

Emotional or thematic labels associated with posts

Platform identifiers to enable cross-platform comparison

The schema is designed to balance clarity, scalability, and analytical usefulness.

Methods & Tools

Relational database design

SQL for data definition and analytical queries

Structured data modeling to support research and insight generation

Key Insights (Examples)

This project enables analysis such as:

Identifying which emotional tones are associated with higher engagement

Comparing how mental health posts perform across platforms

Exploring relationships between content themes and audience interaction

Why This Project Matters

Mental health discourse is highly visible on social media, yet often analyzed in an unstructured way.
This project demonstrates how structured data and database design can support clearer insights into digital mental health communication—skills applicable to data analysis, digital strategy, and research roles.
